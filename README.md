A concurrency library. It's intended to capture the idea of a concurrency model controlled primarily by a hierarchy of state machines (with some unmanaged mutable state possibly), but so far the state machine part is nothing more than a basic prototype. The work so far has been in developing the protocols and the task abstraction.

It's pulled from some of my more recent particle swarm concurrency models, with the intent to fold it back into PSO algorithms for fun and glory. I'm also developing it with game loops in mind -- concurrency all the way down! But for this angle I have nothing more than a few pages of handwritten notes. In other words, this is all in its infancy.
